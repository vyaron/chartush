- Use modern CSS: flex, grid, prefer ems, use variables for all colors
- Use modern CSS nesting (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Nesting/Using) 
- Use plain CSS files (no CSS-in-JS or CSS modules). 
- Create a main.css under style folder and import it in the root of the app. 
- under style folder, create the following folders: setup, basics, cmps
   - in setup have var.css, typography.css
   - in basics have reset.css, helper.css, layout.css, base.css, button.css
- For component-specific styles, create a separate CSS file under style/cmps and import it from the main.css.

- No inline styles unless absolutely necessary (such as dynamic colors in the editor)
- Use lucide icons
